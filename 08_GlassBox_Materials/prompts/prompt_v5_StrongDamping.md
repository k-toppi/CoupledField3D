# Prompt Log: Probing the Strongly Damped Regime

**Objective:** To respond to the reviewer's suggestion (3-2) to explore the parameter space further, specifically in the strongly damped regime (γ > γ_c), to reinforce the theoretical prediction that SR is suppressed.

**Environment:**
*   **Tool:** Google Colab
*   **Language:** Python 3.11
*   **Key Libraries:** Numpy 1.26, Matplotlib 3.8, Pandas 2.1, SciPy 1.13
*   **Repository Commit:** `4f9e1d2` *(Note: This is a placeholder. Replace with the actual 7-digit commit hash from this repo before final publication.)*

## 1. Conversation Snapshot

**[User - Toshiya Konno]**
> We need to run a supplementary simulation to confirm that the SR peak is suppressed in the strongly damped regime, as suggested by the reviewer. Please provide the Python code to run the SNR vs. Temperature simulation with the dissipation coefficient set to `gamma = 2.5`. All other parameters should remain the same as in the previous simulations. The script should be executable in Colab and, upon completion, allow the user to download the resulting CSV data and a publication-quality PDF plot intended for the appendix.

**[AI - Gemini]**
> Understood. Here is the complete Python code for the simulation in the strongly damped regime (γ=2.5). It is designed for Google Colab and will generate and initiate the download for both the data and the figure.

## 2. Outcome

*   **Generated Notebook:** `06_Supplementary_StrongDamping/Sim_StrongDamping_gamma2.5_20250730.ipynb`
*   **Result:** The execution of this code successfully produced **Figure 5 (formerly Fig. A1)** (`figA1_strong_damping.pdf`) and its corresponding data (`SNR_vs_T_gamma_2.5.csv`).
*   **Scientific Conclusion:** The resulting graph clearly shows that the prominent SR peak observed at γ=1.5 is completely suppressed at γ=2.5. This provides strong visual confirmation for the theoretical insight that excessive dissipation destroys the delicate balance required for stochastic resonance.
