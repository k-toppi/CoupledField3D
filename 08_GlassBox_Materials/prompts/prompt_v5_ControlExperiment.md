# Prompt Log: The Control Experiment (Classical System Simulation)

**Objective:** To respond to the reviewer's critical point (C) about the lack of a control experiment and to definitively prove that the observed Stochastic Resonance (SR) is of quantum origin.

**Environment:**
*   **Tool:** Google Colab
*   **Language:** Python 3.11
*   **Key Libraries:** Numpy 1.26, Matplotlib 3.8, Pandas 2.1
*   **Repository Commit:** `a1b2c3d` *(Note: Replace with the actual 7-digit commit hash from this repo at the time of execution before final publication.)*

## 1. Conversation Snapshot

**[User - Toshiya Konno]**
> Please provide the Python code for the control experiment. The core idea is to completely remove the quantum feedback term (`F_feedback = 0`) from the Langevin equation. The simulation parameters should be identical to the previous SR simulations. The code should be executable in Google Colab, and upon completion, it should allow the user to download two files: a CSV file with the SNR vs. Temperature data, and a high-quality, font-embedded PDF of the resulting graph for Figure 4. Please ensure the graph's aesthetics are consistent with previous figures.

**[AI - Gemini]**
> Understood. Here is the complete, self-contained Python code for the control experiment, designed for Google Colab. It sets the feedback force to zero, runs the simulation, and then generates and initiates the download for both the CSV data and the publication-quality PDF plot.

## 2. Outcome

*   **Generated Notebook:** `05_Control_Experiment/Control_Experiment_ClassicalOnly_20250729.ipynb`
*   **Result:** The execution of this AI-generated code successfully produced **Figure 4** (`fig4_control_experiment.pdf`) and its corresponding data (`Control_Experiment_SNR_vs_T_ClassicalOnly.csv`).
*   **Scientific Conclusion:** The resulting graph showed a complete absence of the SNR peak, providing definitive evidence that the stochastic resonance phenomenon observed in our system is fundamentally dependent on the quantum feedback mechanism. This became a cornerstone of the paper's argument.
