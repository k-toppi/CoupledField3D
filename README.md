## Overview

In our previous works (v4.0, v5.0), we reported strong indications of stochastic resonance (SR) in a quantum-classical hybrid system inspired by operator algebras. This paper presents a deeper investigation to elucidate the true physical mechanism underlying this phenomenon. First, through rigorous testing based on their strict definitions, our findings indicate that the observed resonance is not consistent with the definitions of classical stochastic resonance (SR) or coherence resonance (CR). To uncover the essential nature of the phenomenon, we propose a new physical picture that treats the feedback from the quantum field to the classical barrier as a "nonlinear transducer". By employing a rigorous open-loop identification method, we have quantitatively measured the dynamic characteristics of this transducer, its describing function N(A,T). It was found that its effective driving amplitude exhibits a statistically significant monotonic decrease with increasing thermal strength (noise) (Kendall's τ = −0.64, p < 0.001). Furthermore, we determined that while the system's response is perfectly linear under ideal noiseless conditions (T = 0), this linearity is rapidly and strongly broken by the introduction of small amounts of noise (T > 0). These results strongly suggest that the bell-shaped peak observed in v4.0 was not a constructive noise effect like SR/CR, but rather an apparent resonance created within the closed-loop system by a "nonlinear transducer whose dynamic properties are renormalized by noise". This work offers a new and crucial insight into the true role of noise in complex physical systems with internal feedback.
